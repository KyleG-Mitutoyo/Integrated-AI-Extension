# Project information

I'm making an extension for visual studio 2022 that will allow opening a web window with AI chat on it. It has the ability to move text from the visual studio active document to the AI chat prompt text area and moving text from the AI chat's response to the active document. The "VS to AI" button has 3 modes: moving selected text, the whole file contents, or a function. The "AI to VS" button gets selected text or text copied from an AI chat artifact copy button and moves it to a diff view for comparison with the current document.
