# Project information

I'm making an extension for visual studio 2022 that will allow opening a web window with AI chat on it. It will have buttons for copying and pasting contents from visual studio into the chat window. The chat window needs to remember a user's login info even when visual studio or the PC is restarted. This extension is only for private/company use, so it won't need to be distributed publicly, but I may want to give it to coworkers.

# Framework

This project uses .Net Framework 4.7.2
